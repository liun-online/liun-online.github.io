I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavier-bresson-738585b">Prof. Xavier Bresson</a>. Before joining NUS, I received my M.S. and B.E. at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, supervised by <a href="http://www.shichuan.org/">Prof. Chuan Shi</a> and <a href="https://wangxiaocs.github.io/">Prof. Xiao Wang</a>.

My research interests include Graph Neural Network, Graph Transformer, Graph Signal Processing and Graph Self-supervised Learning. Now, I am engaging in the graph diffusion generation technique and its applications on AI4Material.
